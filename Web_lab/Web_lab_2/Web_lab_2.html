                        The karst seascape of Halong Bay is one of the world's most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                        Thousands of limestone islands sit within this bay in the Gulf of Tonkin, eroded into jagged pinnacles by wind and water
                        action over millennia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the bay's scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. Opt for at least an overnight tour to see
                        Halong Bay's iconic views as a day trip doesn't do it justice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and
                        the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply
                        cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

                    <p>
                        For big city fans, no visit to Vietnam is really complete without a visit to Ho Chi Minh City, the buzzing and crazy
                        commercial hub of the country. The streets are an insane clog of motorbikes and cars, the restaurant and café scene is
                        incredibly cosmopolitan, and the shopping is the best in the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At its center is Dong Khoi, a relatively small and easily navigable central district, which holds most of the city's
                        sights. Here, you'll find the HCMC Museum, with a brilliant collection of artifacts that weaves together the story of
                        the city, and the grand Notre Dame Cathedral, built in the late 19th century.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Check out the old district of Da Kao nearby for some of the best surviving examples of the city's French colonial
                        architecture and also to visit the Jade Emperor Pagoda with its dazzling array of Buddhist and Taoist religious
                        iconography. Afterwards, the History Museum is a must-do for history fans with stacks of relics on display from various
                        archaeological sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For many visitors, the two big-hitter attractions not to miss are just a little out of the center, along Nguyen Thi Minh
                        Khai Street. The Reunification Palace, then known as Independence Palace, was the residence for South Vietnam's
                        president. It's chiefly famous as the spot where North Vietnam's tanks stopped on 30 April 1975, officially ending the
                        war. It's a completely fascinating place to visit complete with 1960s furnishings still in situ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nearby is the War Remnants Museum, which although very obviously biased, paints a disturbing picture of the brutality of
                        war and the many atrocities committed by US Forces during their Vietnam campaign.

                        problem, an hour-long helicopter transfer is also available.</p></div>

                            was renamed Ho Chi
                            Minh City, after the spiritual leader of Vietnamese Communism, but residents were so reluctant to adopt the
                            new name
                            that authorities kept the official name but the city centre is still called Saigon.</p></div>

                        and sleek skyscrapers as well as ornate temples and pagodas. The city is also filled with rooftop bars that overlook
